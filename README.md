## Project Documentation

This repository currently contains documentation scaffolding to help you document public APIs, functions, and components as code is added.

### Docs
- API Reference: `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`
- Usage Guide: `docs/USAGE_GUIDE.md`

### Getting Started
1. Add source files to the repository
2. For each new public API/component, add an entry to `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`
3. Update usage examples in `docs/USAGE_GUIDE.md`

### Contributing
Please keep documentation current with code changes. Open PRs that update both code and docs together.
