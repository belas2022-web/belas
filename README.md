Welcome. This repository currently has no source code files. As code is added, please keep public APIs documented.

## Documentation

- API Reference: see `docs/API.md` for structure, templates, and examples to document exported functions, components, endpoints, and CLIs.

## Contributing to docs

1. When you add an exported function/component, add an entry in `docs/API.md` following the provided templates.
2. Include minimal and realistic examples that compile/run.
3. Describe parameters, return types, defaults, and error cases.
4. Update this README with links to major modules as the codebase grows.

## Getting started

- Clone the repo and add your first module under a `src/` directory.
- Use consistent naming, semantic versioning, and update docs with every change.
